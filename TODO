need a test that confirms that every successive version compares
greater (according to version.pm) to the version before it.

 [ether@jaeger ~]$; perl -Mversion -wle'print version->parse("3.1")->numify;
 print version->parse("3.14")->numify; print version->parse("3.141")->numify;
 print version->parse("3.1415")->numify; print version->parse("3.14159")->numify'
 3.100
 3.140
 3.141
 3.141500
 3.141590



need to include code that generates the digits using newtonian approximation,
so we get more sigfigs.
allow this to be exported too.


patch https://metacpan.org/pod/lambda to have a link to the lambda sub as a pod header.
