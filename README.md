# NAME

Acme::Pi - Mmm, pie

# VERSION

version 3

# SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::Pi;

    ...that's it, really

# DESCRIPTION

This distribution was created to celebrate [Pi Day](http://www.piday.org/),
as well as to demonstrate yet another example of a pathological `$VERSION`.
It defines its version as:

    $Acme::Pi::VERSION = atan2(1,1) * 4;
